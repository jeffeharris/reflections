How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to compare the files and identify possible differences that could
	make it faster for me to find and fix the issue.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could see how the file changes over time and go back to see when changes
	wer made. It's really difficult to recall why you changed something or how
	it worked before you made a change. Having a file history would provide easy 
	access to the previous versions of your code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that you can make a logical decision on when to commit. Cons are
	that it isn't standard for everyone so it's subjective and prone to error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The way the file is stored seems like it could take up a lot of space. The 
	purpose of the google doc is also different than that of a system of files
	that work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows you the complete history of commits which, if done correctly
		will show you all changes & updates made and the commit id's
	git diff - allows you to comapre commits and see what updates were made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Being able to make changes in code means that you can test something and
	know that if you break something you can always go back and find what caused
	the issue and then youc an fix it. Even if you don't find the issue right
	away you are able to go back in time, identify when the issue was introduced
	and tehn see what the difference was.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
